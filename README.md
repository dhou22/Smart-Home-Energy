### Key Research Insights Applied

1. **Feature Selection (Ahmad et al., 2024):** https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781394231522.ch12  
   Ensemble approaches combining correlation analysis, mutual information, and Random Forest importance achieve superior feature selection compared to single-method approaches, reducing overfitting by 15-20%.

2. **Anti-Leakage Engineering (Servis, 2024):** https://sertiscorp.medium.com/a-practical-time-series-forecasting-guideline-for-machine-learning-part-ii-aea360b06ce2  
   Enforcing lag periods greater than or equal to forecast horizons prevents look-ahead bias, reducing artificially inflated R² scores from >0.99 to realistic ranges of 0.85-0.94.

3. **Temporal Interpolation:** Time-based interpolation for missing values preserves temporal continuity better than forward-fill or mean imputation, reducing RMSE by 8-12% in energy time series.

4. **CPU Optimization (Shi et al., 2024):** https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/8/1926  
   Reducing Random Forest depth (max_depth=15) and tree count (n_estimators=100) while increasing min_samples_leaf (10) maintains 95% of full-model accuracy with 60% faster training.

5. **Stratified Sampling (Lu et al., 2021):** https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02062  
   Variance-reduced training with stratified sampling for forecasting models addresses heterogeneity in temporal patterns, improving gradient estimation and reducing training time in large-scale time series forecasting.

6. **XGBoost Optimization (Chen & Guestrin, 2016):** https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754  
   Histogram-based split-finding algorithm with built-in cross-validation enables early stopping to prevent overfitting while maintaining computational efficiency through cache-aware prefetching and sparsity-aware algorithms.

7. **Hybrid Evaluation Framework:** Tolerance-based classification metrics (±10% accuracy, F1-score) complement regression metrics, providing operational deployment context where exact predictions are less critical than acceptable ranges.

---

## Data Processing Stages

## [1] Data Loading & Parsing

### Parsing Strategy

The raw dataset employs semicolon-separated values with non-standard missing value encodings (`?`). Our parsing pipeline implements:

1. **Datetime Consolidation:** Merging separate date and time columns into unified ISO 8601 timestamps
2. **Type Optimization:** Converting to appropriate numeric dtypes (float32)
3. **Missing Value Marking:** Explicit identification of `?` markers as `NaN`

**Technical Implementation:** `pandas.read_csv()` with custom date parser ensuring correct temporal ordering.

**Research Justification:** Follows data quality assessment principles from energy forecasting literature emphasizing proper temporal indexing.

---

## [2] Data Cleaning & Quality Assurance

<img width="1468" height="647" alt="Capture d&#39;écran 2025-12-04 172319" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75fdef49-43e9-46f6-a0b7-ccae85ba7346" />

------

### Initial Assessment

- **Missing Values:** 25,979 records (1.25% of dataset)
- **Temporal Gaps:** Irregular intervals due to sensor failures
- **Physical Anomalies:** Voltage readings outside European standard range (220-260V)
- **Statistical Outliers:** Power consumption exceeding 3σ from mean

### Missing Value Imputation Strategy

**Method:** Temporal interpolation (`method='time'`) with bidirectional filling (`limit_direction='both'`)

**Research Foundation:** Time-based interpolation preserves temporal continuity essential for energy time series (Wang et al., 2023).

**Mathematical Formulation:**

For a missing value at time $t_i$ between known values at $t_{i-1}$ and $t_{i+1}$:

$$\hat{y}(t_i) = y(t_{i-1}) + \frac{t_i - t_{i-1}}{t_{i+1} - t_{i-1}} \times [y(t_{i+1}) - y(t_{i-1})]$$



**Results:** 100% imputation success rate (25,979 → 0 missing values)

### Outlier Detection

**Interquartile Range (IQR) Method:**

$$\text{Lower Bound} = Q_1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$$
$$\text{Upper Bound} = Q_3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$$

where $\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1$ (interquartile range).

**Rationale:** Less sensitive to extreme values compared to z-score approaches, making it suitable for energy data with natural variability.

### Physical Constraint Validation

Enforced domain-specific constraints based on European electrical standards:

| Constraint | Minimum | Maximum | Justification |
|------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Active Power | 0 kW | 15 kW | Physical impossibility of negative consumption |
| Voltage | 220 V | 260 V | EN 50160 standard: 230V ±10% |
| Current | 0 A | 60 A | Residential circuit breaker ratings |

**Result:** Removed 0.8% of records violating physical constraints.

## [3] Feature Engineering: Anti-Leakage Design

<img width="1595" height="837" alt="Capture d&#39;écran 2025-12-04 191113" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89b540dd-71c9-4f0c-a5b0-ed3aa9965fdc" />

-----

### Critical Principle: Preventing Data Leakage

**Research Foundation:** Servis (2024) emphasizes that lag period must be ≥ forecast horizon to prevent look-ahead bias.

A fundamental requirement in time series forecasting is ensuring features are constructed using only information available at prediction time, avoiding look-ahead bias that artificially inflates model performance.

### Forbidden Variables Excluded

Variables directly computed from the target or exhibiting correlation > 0.95 were systematically removed:
- `Sub_metering_1/2/3` (computed from target components)
- `Global_intensity` (perfect correlation r=1.00)
- `Voltage` (high correlation r>0.85)
- `Global_reactive_power` (derived feature)
- `apparent_power` (calculated field)

**Research Justification:** Zhang & Chen (2022) demonstrate that multicollinearity degrades model interpretability and stability.

### Feature Categories

#### 3.1 Temporal Cyclical Features

**Calendar-based features** capturing daily, weekly, and annual patterns:
- Linear: `hour`, `day_of_week`, `month`, `quarter`
- Binary: `is_weekend`, `is_business_hour`, `is_peak_hour`
- Categorical: `season` (winter/spring/summer/fall)

**Cyclical Encoding:** Preserving periodicity using trigonometric transformation:

**Scientific Justification:** Sine-cosine encoding ensures the model recognizes that hour 23 is temporally close to hour 0 (Wang et al., 2023).

#### 3.2 Lag Features (Autoregressive Components)

Historical consumption values delayed by predefined intervals:

**Implemented lags:** 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 minutes | 1, 6, 12 hours | 1, 7 days


**Anti-leakage guarantee:** All lags $\geq 1$ to strictly prevent using future information (Servis, 2024).

#### 3.3 Rolling Window Statistics

Moving averages and standard deviations over temporal windows:

**Windows:** 60 minutes (1h), 360 minutes (6h), 1440 minutes (24h)



**Critical Safeguard:** `.shift(1)` applied before rolling calculation to exclude current timestep.

**Research Foundation:** Ahmad et al. (2024) recommend rolling statistics for capturing recent trends without data leakage.

### Validation Pipeline



**Final Feature Count:** 39 engineered features

-----

**Daily Profile:**
- Morning surge: 7:00-9:00 AM (avg 1.8 kW)
- Evening peak: 18:00-21:00 PM (avg 2.4 kW)
- Nighttime baseline: 0:00-6:00 AM (avg 0.5 kW)

### Correlation Analysis Results

<img width="5951" height="1796" alt="correlation_matrices" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bce99f9-47b6-4baf-8a03-d96b581a88f4" />

-----

**Top correlates with target (after removing forbidden variables):**
- `Sub_metering_3`: r = 0.73 (electric heating)
- `Sub_metering_1`: r = 0.21 (kitchen appliances)

**Interpretation:** All three correlation matrices (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall) show consistent patterns, validating linear relationships.

### Mutual Information vs Correlation

<img width="2972" height="1768" alt="mi_vs_correlation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03425753-a2ee-41b1-933d-b373e225a71c" />

-----

**Key Finding:** Variables showing high MI but low Pearson correlation indicate non-linear relationships captured by mutual information analysis (Ahmad et al., 2024).

### Principal Component Analysis

<img width="2971" height="1768" alt="pca_variance" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05398bcf-bb8d-4626-b57b-b7d7591e86dd" />

-----

**Variance Explained:** 
- PC1: 32.7% (individual variance)
- Cumulative: 95% threshold reached at PC5
- Total components needed: 5 out of 6

**Interpretation:** High dimensionality reduction potential exists, but we retain original features for interpretability in operational deployment.
